It enables developers to use HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS3 and leverage native functionalities of mobile devices to build apps tailored for those devices. The platform currently supports Android, iOS, and Windows and provides a broad set of APIs to access that native functionalities via a consistent and uniform JavaScript interface for the supported operating systems.</p><br/><p>Appverse Mobile is licensed under the Appverse Public License (APL), which is based on the Mozilla Public License V2.0.

The platform has been open-sourced so that the community can benefit from this work and indeed contribute to make it even better! You don't need to waste time on the technical details of individual devices, and you have the freedom to use native device functionality from your HTML5 app. So you can focus on your next cutting-edge app while we make sure it runs optimally on Appverse Mobile.</p></div></div><div class="overview-horitzontal-bottom-line overview-large-item overview-bottom-left-corner"></div><div class="overview-horitzontal-top-line overview-large-item overview-top-right-corner"></div><div class="row"><div id="overview-second-item-mobile" class="col-lg-12 overview-item-text-left"><h2>Depth vs Breadth</h2><p>Appverse Mobile provides deep integration with native device functionality by giving developers a rich, fine-grained JavaScript API with which to enable their HTML5 apps.
