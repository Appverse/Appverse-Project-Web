Connected consumer products from traditional handsets to sophisticated smartphones and other mobile computing devices to rich web applications - are continuously growing in functionality. Open software is key in helping to drive the creativity and innovation that will enable these devices to provide more advanced services – and thus greater value - than ever before. In recognition of this market dynamic, GFT formed Appverse and The Appverse Project was born.</p><p>GFT Appverse is leading the way in collaborative development with the creation of The Appverse Project, which brings together dedicated engineers to focus on areas and issues of growing innovation. The Appverse goal is to invest greater resources into the enablement and optimization of open source software and the facilitation of open collaboration between our clients, users and the community as a whole. To that end, the organization has been purpose-designed, to work closely with the open source community and special interest groups to speed up the collaborative process in the context of open innovation.</p><p>Mobile application development, rich internet web applications, user experience, and extracting value from big data are among our priorities. We invite both individuals and organizations to accompany us on a journey that we believe to be an essential step towards the future of modern UI software development.</p></div><hr><div class="row"><h2>Why use Appverse?</h2><div class="row three-column"><div id="first-column-why-appverse" class="col-xs-12 col-lg-4"><img class="img-responsive three-column-img" src="images/b7fbcff4.open-source.png" alt="Generic placeholder image"><h3>Open Source</h3><p class="three-column">Appverse is a stable platform with more than 4 years of proven development behind it.
