<div class="row"><div class="col-lg-12 devices-content-introduction"><h2>Appverse Web</h2><p>Appverse Web is an open-source web application development platform developed by GFT Appverse and designed to make web developers lives easier. We do this by providing architectural solutions built on proven Java-based open-source frameworks and third-party libraries both for server-sides and front-ends.</p><br/><p>Why reinvent the wheel? Appverse Web offers "glue-code" so web developers can benefit from successful open source projects. It also delivers a wide range of architectural and design templates and best practices that will make the project architectures more robust and flexible, at the same time reducing overhead and risk. Appverse saves you time and headaches by providing a tried and true solution for multiple scenarios – there's no need to invest a ton of time in technical matters, and you can focus on building functionality from day one. And that's not all… Appverse Web stays up-to-date and in constant-growth mode thanks to the participating community, offering more and more technical solutions for different front-end and server-side scenarios.</p></div></div><div class="row"><div id="overview-first-item-web" class="col-lg-12 overview-item-text-right"><h2>Appverse Web flexibility</h2><p>Appverse Web is an open-source environment, not a closed development platform. It reduces the risk of bad architectural practices by providing and enforcing a wide set of best practices and architectural templates, but it’s completely open and flexible. It can be extended with your own solutions or integrated with new third-party libraries and frameworks. In fact, we would be delighted to have you contribute your solutions to make Appverse even more open.</p></div></div><div class="overview-horitzontal-bottom-line overview-large-item overview-bottom-left-corner"></div><div class="overview-horitzontal-top-line overview-large-item overview-top-right-corner"></div><div class="row"><div id="overview-second-item-web" class="col-lg-12 overview-item-text-left"><h2>Maximize your HTML5 potential</h2><p>Appverse Web foundations are built on HTML5 standards and leverage its advanced features to apply them to cutting-edge web apps.
